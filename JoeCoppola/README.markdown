# Joe Coppola's "Fair" Market Simulator

The idea to make a sort of web game where you play as a small investment firm handling pensions of various businesses. This would be a very simplified simulation of the stock exchange, with the goal of investing in various stocks to advance said pensions. However the catch is that you will be a victim of high frequency predators, eventually bankrupting the investment firm you work at each play through. 

At the end the user would be assessed in their attempts to keep the investment firm afloat. This would show them how much money they lost in result of high frequency trading, and other necessary data. 

This game idea also comes from a game Andy Phelps showed my incoming freshmen class four years ago. This game was where you would have to fire individuals, but as you did you would be presented with the number of kids that person had as well as other various personal facts. This form of procedural rhetoric in games can deliver a strong message, and I believe my game idea could provide such rhetoric to the person playing the game. 

Due to how little time remains in the semester, I would build this game entirely with web technologies. This way I can have it so that a server would run a stock market as multiple clients play this game, all affect the game. Since this game would be a simulation of the stock exchange, I will have a short list of assets that would be need to be created. This would allow me to focus more on simulating a stock exchange, and what I would have to do to simplify it. That would be the harder task I believe, but is still doable.
