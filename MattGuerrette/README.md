# VixenEditor

Currently, I am developing an open source game engine in C++ called Vixen Engine. Since open sourcing that game engine,
the project has grown to have multiple developers, as well as those wishing to create games using this engine. As a result,
there is now a need for a dedicated application with which game designers can bring their ideas to life.

For my project, I am hoping to have a working prototype of Vixen Editor interfacing with Vixen Engine, and allowing for basic
level creation and prefab editing.
