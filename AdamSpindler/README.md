I plan to use a facial recognition library and a neural network to try and guess attributes about people. With just a few measurements, face dimensions, and the position of the eyes, nose and mouth I want to see what I can get the neural network can predict. Apple has a facial recognition library that could be used in Swift and one of my friends wrote an open source neural network in Swift. With the results that I get I'll write a summary of what I've found.
