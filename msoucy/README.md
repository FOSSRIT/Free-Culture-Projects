MACTrack

A few years ago, I worked with a few friends (@gregjurman and @alexanderkyte) at a hackathon to revamp a sample product that a sponsor was working on, now released as [Density](http://density.io).
For my project, I propose a variation of the same idea: use a Raspberry Pi with a wi-fi adaptor to track how often different devices are within a certain area. This will give me a rough estimate of the number of people in a given area, though their identities will be dissociated from their devices.

This will be an exercise in tracking populations, without their knowledge, and showing the potential (ab)use that can be done. All data gathered will be logged for analysis but not shared with any third parties.
