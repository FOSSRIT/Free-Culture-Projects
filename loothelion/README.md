Free and Open Culture Final Project
===================================

I'm currently working on a set of OpenGL tutorials for Professors Jacobs and
Schwartz. While going through and refurbishing this list of tutorials I've found
a lot of common mistakes made by students when working on C++ and OpenGL
projects in Visual Studio. This piece will compare and contrast student made tutorials to
ones made in Free and Open Source Software communities.
