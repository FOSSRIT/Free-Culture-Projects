I would like to craft a literal interpretation of Pasquale's work. I wish to construct a physical device in the form of a black box. This box will be sealed, and have no surface features besides a single ethernet port. The device will operate in the following ways:

- The device will be self-powered, and will remain active for approximately 6 months.
- The device will brick itself after the 6 month time span has elapsed.
- The device will brick itself if any attempt is made to open it.
- The device's ethernet port will be active, and will offer encryption services free of *monetary* charge. The implementation of the encryption algorithm will be my own, and will be proprietary.

I'm not at liberty to discuss any technical details relating to the internal composition or workings of the device.
