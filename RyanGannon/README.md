# StoryTree: An Interactive Storytelling Program

StoryTree is (will be) a command-line application for anonymous interactive storytelling.  

The premise is simple.  Upon launching the application (which will most likely use a terminal user interface, as opposed
to a graphical one), the user can write, read, and browse stories, written by users in <300 word chunks.  

A few catches:
    
1. Once you have contributed a "chunk" to a story, you can never contribute to it again, and you no longer have any
   say in its direction.
    
2. All contributed chunks are completely anonymous.
    
3. Each chunk of a story can have up to three child chunks.  While browsing stories to read/contribute to, you can mark
   chunks as "favorites", which are tracked, giving readers an idea of which path of the story is most interesting, and
   least likely to be full of racial slurs, adding a certain amount of troll-proofing.

This is an adaptation of a project I've wanted to work on for a little while (a program for reading/writing Choose-your-
own-adventure stories), which I want to use to see how a community might form, with the only basis of interation being
the stories.  I also think questions like "who is the author here?" and "does it matter?" seem inevitable.


## FAQ (Subject to change)

### Is this idea fully fleshed-out and designed?

Of course not.

### Why do you want to do this?

I wanted to adapt something I already wanted to work on, and I wanted it to revolve around one of the themes of the
class that was less grim than something involving a deliberate invasion of privacy, or worse, **proprietary software**.

### Do you expect to be able to finish this?

I expect to be able to illustrate some of the themes we've discussed about publics and authorship.

### Are you working solo?

That depends.  If anyone else thinks this idea is super groovy, I'd be willing to group up.
